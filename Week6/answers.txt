Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The first simulation with 10 simulations and the second with 100 placed brazil first and then started to stabilize
putting belgium first with makes more sense.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After the number of 100 simulations, the results started to stabilize and i receive almost the same result with the increasing
number of simulations. So, i think that 1000 simulations is good enough.
